# IRC for Chrome

This is an IRC client Chrome app. It's using the experimental socket
support in Chrome. **It may stop working in a future version of
Chrome!**

# Installing

**Currently requires the dev channel version of Chrome, or Canary**

First you need to enable Experimental Extension APIs in Chrome. You can do
this by going to chrome://flags and searching for "Experimental Extension
APIs" and clicking Enable. You'll have to restart Chrome.

Now you can download and install the extension. It's currently available
as a package here: https://github.com/progrium/ircv/downloads

It should download, ask for permissions, and then get added to your list
of Chrome Apps. Click to run and enjoy!
