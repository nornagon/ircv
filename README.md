# [CIRC](http://noahsug.github.com/circ)
**An IRC client in the shape of a packaged Chrome app**

CIRC uses the chrome.socket API to connect directly to IRC servers without needing a proxy. It has a ton of other killer features as well such as syncing your IRC state accross all your devices and allowing you to use a single IRC connection on multiple devices simultaneously.

Check out the documentation here: https://github.com/noahsug/circ/wiki

## Running

**Currently requires the dev channel version of Chrome, or Canary**

CIRC is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store. In the mean time you can run it from the source code. Install CoffeeScript, run "make build", and then use the "load unpackaged extention" tool in Chrome to add CIRC to your apps.
